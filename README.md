## Development Schedule



Take a realistic look at you schedule and your commitments and decide on how you will spend the time necessary to complete the project. You can use the milestones from the project spec to help guide this description. You should be as specific as possible.

Create another section called ## Emoji Chooser. Write a description how you initalize the board. This information should include how you will assign emojis to trainer and each pokemon. You should describe how you will initialize the parameters N, P, and T where N is the size of the board, P is the number of pokemon, and T is the number of trainers. You should also describe how those parameters will create separate machines. That is, you should discuss how you will create the proper dockercompose.yml, Dockerfile, Protocol Buffer files.
